# Arena Fighting Game

A text based game about fighting in arena.

## Purpose

This project was created as a way to teach/learn about programing (in Python) in interesting and entertaining way.
It allows students to have tangible results while practicing programming.
It covers topics from basic such as variables definition to complex ones as inheritance.

It is used and refined by me ([Dice-Sensei](https://github.com/Dice-Sensei)) as part of extracurricular activities - Programming Course ("Kroužek programování").

## Assignment

Assignment is not defined precisely and there are lots of places for self interpretation - that is for stimulating students to ask questions, think for themselves about what they are creating what they are doing.
If it was precisely defined AI could generate it with pretty good accuracy and there would be no need for students to become programmers.

Assignment is in file Assignment.md it is written in Czech language and will be updated (ir)regularly as course progresses.
