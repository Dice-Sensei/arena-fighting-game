# Arena Fighting Game

A text based game about fighting in arena.

## Purpose

This project was created as a way to teach/learn about programing (in Python) in interesting and entertaining way.
It allows students to have tangible results while practicing programming.
It covers topics from basic such as variables definition to complex ones as inheritance.

It is used and refined by me (Dice-Sensei) as part of extracurricular activities - "Kroužek programování".
